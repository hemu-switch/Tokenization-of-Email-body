    "body": "Body-Type: plain-text\r\n\r\nTo Whom this may concern:\r\n\r\nPlease note that Colstrip tripped @ approx. 13:20 today.  I picked up tranny from BPA (Mid-C to MPC SYS) for 62 MW.  The first hour of the cut was an integrated number of 41MW.  After Starting HE 15 on the cut was for the full 62 MW each hour.  The deal numbers affected by this cut were reduced by the appropriate amount (711291 and 709803) and new deals were made to correct enpower.  These new deals are 714148 and 714150.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please see me.  My number @ the real time desk is 1-800-684-1336.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nBert Meyers\r\n\r\n***********\r\nEDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.
